# Input:            INTEGER mod, POLY modPoly
# Output:           2D STRING ARRAY answer, 2D POLY ARRAY answer-poly
# Functionality:    Generate the full addition table of F. Return it once with elements pretty printed and
#                   once with elements as POLYâ€™s.
#                   In final format, the output is supposed to be a sequence of rows (see examples).
