# Input:            INTEGER mod, POLY modPoly, POLY a
# Output:           STRING answer, POLY answer-poly
# Functionality:    Compute the multiplicative inverse of a, i.e., the element f ∈ F such that a · f = 1
#                   (use for instance Algorithm 4.1.5, which is based on the Extended Euclidean algorithm).
#                   Output f as pretty print string and as POLY.
