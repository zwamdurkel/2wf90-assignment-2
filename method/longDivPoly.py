# Input:            INTEGER mod, POLY f, POLY g
# Output:           STRING answ-q, STRING answ-r, POLY answ-q-poly, POLY answ-r-poly
# Functionality:    Execute a long division to compute polynomials q,
#                   r ∈ Z/pZ[X] such that f = q · g + r in Z/pZ[X] (see e.g. Algorithm 2.2.2).
#                   Output q and r as pretty print string and as POLY, each.
