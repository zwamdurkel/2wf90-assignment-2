# Input:            INTEGER mod, POLY f, POLY g
# Output:           STRING answ-a, STRING answ-b, STRING answ-d, POLY answ-a-poly, POLY answ-b-poly, POLY answ-d-poly
# Functionality:    execute the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute polynomials a, b, d∈Z/pZ[X]
#                   such that af + bg = d = gcd(f, g) in Z/pZ[X].
#                   Remember, that we defined the gcd to be monic, i.e.,
#                   the leading coefficient has to be 1 (seeAlgorithms 2.2.10).
#                   Output a, b, and d as pretty print string and as POLY, each.
